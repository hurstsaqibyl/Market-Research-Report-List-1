<p><ul><li>High Ankle Sprains</li><li>Sub-acute Ankle Sprains</li><li>Chronic Ankle Sprains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ankle splints market caters to three primary applications: high ankle sprains, sub-acute ankle sprains, and chronic ankle sprains. High ankle sprains involve damage to the ligaments above the ankle, requiring rigid support to facilitate healing. Sub-acute ankle sprains, which occur during recovery, benefit from moderate support and flexibility to prevent re-injury. Chronic ankle sprains, resulting from recurrent injury, necessitate splints that offer both stabilization and motion control, aiding long-term rehabilitation and functionality for affected individuals.</p></p>
