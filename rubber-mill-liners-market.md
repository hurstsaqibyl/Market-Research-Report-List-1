<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Mill Liners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Smoothing Liner</li><li>Non-smooth Liner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rubber mill liners are essential components in grinding mills, designed to protect the mill shell and enhance performance. They come in two main types: smoothing liners and non-smooth liners. Smoothing liners provide a flat surface that reduces friction and wear while promoting a uniform flow of materials within the mill. In contrast, non-smooth liners feature raised profiles or contours that create turbulence, improving material engagement and grinding efficiency. Both types cater to different milling processes and operational requirements.</p></p>
